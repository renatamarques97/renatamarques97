### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Renata Marques. I am a Software Developer and Computer Scientist with hands-on experience working with Ruby and JavaScript in fast-paced agile environments. I've worked in a wide variety of companies and business domains, building scalable software, mostly working on improving existing and legacy applications. Open source enthusiast.

I enjoy building things with Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, GatsbyJS, Git, PostgreSQL, Redis, REST, and GraphQL.

I also write technical blog posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to/renatamarques97).

In my free time, I enjoy watching and discussing movies and TV shows, reading books, listening to music, taking photographs, and creating videos.

Would you like to find me?
