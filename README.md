### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Renata Marques. I am a Software Developer and Computer Scientist with hands-on experience working with Ruby and Javascript in fast paced agile environments. I've worked in a wide variety of companies and business domains, building scalable software, mostly working on improving existing and legacy applications. Open source enthusiastic.

I like to build things with Ruby, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, ReactJs, GatsbyJs, Git, PostgreSQL, Redis, Rest, and GraphQL.

In my free time I like to watch and discuss about movies and TV shows, to read books, to listen to music, to photopraph and make some videos.

Would you like to find me?
